1) From which Country are most transactions originating? How many transactions is this?

    SELECT 
    loc.CountryName as country,
    count(distinct trans.UniqueId) as total_transactions 
    FROM 
    FLIGHT_TRANSACTIONS trans JOIN FLIGHT_LOCATIONS loc
    on trans.OriginAirportCode = loc.AirportCode
    group by loc.CountryName
 
 
2) What's the split between domestic vs international transactions?     
    SELECT 
    sum(case when loc_dept.Region = loc_arival.Region then 1 else 0 end) as domestic_flights,
    sum(case when loc_dept.Region <> loc_arival.Region then 1 else 0 end) as international_flights
    FROM 
    FLIGHT_TRANSACTIONS trans JOIN FLIGHT_LOCATIONS loc_dept
    on trans.DepartureAirportCode = loc_dept.AirportCode
    JOIN FLIGHT_LOCATIONS loc_arival
    on trans.ArrivalAirportCode = loc_arival.AirportCode
    
    
 3) What's the distribution of number of segments included in transactions?   
    SELECT 
    UniqueId,
    SegmentNumber,
    count(1) as segment_count 
    FROM FLIGHT_TRANSACTIONS
    group by 
    UniqueId,
    SegmentNumber
